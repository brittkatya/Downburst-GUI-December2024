This graphical user interface consists of 10 analytical and semi-empircal downburst models. Users can manipulate the input parameters of the models through entering them into text boxes or adjusting sliders. Additionally, users can opt to save an image of the resulting velocity plots, or a file containing the data outputted by the model. This GUI was created in the MATLAB App Designer. 

If a user already has MATLAB, they can download all 10 model files and the "DownburstModelsGUI" file which is the model selection menu. In order to utilize the model selection menu, and use the individual GUI's of each model, DownburstModelsGUI.mlapp and the individual model .mlapp files ***must be in the same folder.*** 

The individual models are:
* Abd-Elaal, Mills, & Ma (2013)
* Chay, Albermani, & Wilson (2006)
* Holmes & Oliver (2000)
* Li et al. (2012)
* Moeini & Romanic (2023)
* Oseguera & Bowles (1988)
* Verhoff (1963)
* Vicroy (1992)
* Wood et al. (2001)
* Xhelaj, Burlando, & Solari (2020)
